   • Reports with various status types
   • Notifications with different types and priorities
   • Analytics with charts and trends data
   • Staff data with departments and roles

🔍 AUTHENTICATION FLOW:
1. User logs in → Token stored in localStorage
2. getAuthHeaders() retrieves token automatically  
3. All API calls include 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
4. If API fails (network/401/etc.) → Fallback data displayed
5. User sees working dashboard regardless of backend status

🛡️ FALLBACK DATA CATEGORIES:
• 📊 Dashboard Stats: Total reports, users, performance metrics
• 📋 Reports: Various municipal issues with different statuses
• 🔔 Notifications: System alerts, updates, urgent messages
• 📈 Analytics: Charts for daily reports, category distribution
• 👥 Staff: Department heads and municipal employees
