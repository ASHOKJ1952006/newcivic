# 🎯 Smart Auto-Detection Testing Guide

## ✅ **System Status: Ready!**
- **Frontend**: `http://localhost:3001/citizen-dashboard`
- **Backend**: Smart detection server running on port 5001

## 🧪 **How to Test Different Issue Types**

The system now intelligently detects different issues based on:
1. **Filename keywords** (primary detection method)
2. **Random selection** (when no keywords found)

### **📋 Test Different Categories:**

## 🛣️ **Road Issues**
Upload images with filenames containing:
- `road_damage.jpg` → **Road Damage** (High severity)
- `pothole_street.png` → **Pothole** (Medium severity)
- `street_crack.jpeg` → **Road/Pothole** (Random)

## 💡 **Street Lighting**
Upload images with filenames containing:
- `street_light.jpg` → **Street Light Issue** (Low severity)
- `lamp_broken.png` → **Street Light Issue** (Low severity)
- `light_malfunction.jpeg` → **Street Light Issue** (Low severity)

## 🗑️ **Garbage Collection**
Upload images with filenames containing:
- `garbage_pile.jpg` → **Garbage Issue** (Medium severity)
- `trash_accumulation.png` → **Garbage Issue** (Medium severity)
- `waste_collection.jpeg` → **Garbage Issue** (Medium severity)

## 🌊 **Water & Drainage**
Upload images with filenames containing:
- `drainage_blocked.jpg` → **Drainage Issue** (High severity)
- `water_leak.png` → **Water Supply Issue** (High severity)
- `drain_overflow.jpeg` → **Drainage/Water** (Random)

## 🚦 **Traffic Issues**
Upload images with filenames containing:
- `traffic_signal.jpg` → **Traffic Issue** (Medium severity)
- `traffic_jam.png` → **Traffic Issue** (Medium severity)
- `signal_malfunction.jpeg` → **Traffic Issue** (Medium severity)

## ⚡ **Electrical Issues**
Upload images with filenames containing:
- `electric_pole.jpg` → **Electrical Issue** (High severity)
- `power_outage.png` → **Electrical Issue** (High severity)
- `electricity_problem.jpeg` → **Electrical Issue** (High severity)

## 🎲 **Random Detection**
Upload any image without keywords:
- `photo1.jpg` → **Random Issue Type**
- `image.png` → **Random Issue Type**
- `test.jpeg` → **Random Issue Type**

## 🔄 **Expected Auto-Fill Results:**

Each issue type will auto-fill:
- ✅ **Title**: Generated based on issue type
- ✅ **Description**: Detailed, specific description
- ✅ **Category**: Mapped to form categories
- ✅ **Priority**: Based on severity (High/Medium/Low)

## 🎯 **Testing Steps:**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3001/citizen-dashboard`
2. Rename your test images with the keywords above
3. Upload and watch different auto-detection results!
4. Try multiple images to see variety

**Now you'll get different results for different types of issues!** 🚀
